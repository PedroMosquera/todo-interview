# Dynatrace Fullstack Interview
Hello! ðŸ‘‹

We need your help! One of our software engineers couldn't finish his task before going on holidays, so we're looking for a full stack engineer to be able to finish it.

The code is written in Angular 10 and Java 8, and this is the task our colleague left undone:
* As a user, I want an application that displays a list of tasks and allows me to add tasks (short text) to the list, as well as marking them as "done".
* As a user, I want to be able to access my list at any time and from different browsers

Time: 1h 45m âŒ›

## Requirements ðŸ”§
* Your favorite IDE
* Java JDK 8 (or greater)
* Angular CLI (optional)

## Build & run ðŸš€
* Check `api/README` for the REST API
* Check `app/README` for the UI

## Tips & tricks ðŸ’¡
* Raise questions and clarifications if needed
* Discuss about the implementation
* Keep it simple, stupid! (KISS)
